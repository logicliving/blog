### Model, View, Controller Relationship?
I am trying to understand the relationship between the diffrent components of rails. How the diffrent components interact with each other is important to me. I found that the routes.rb is very important in specifying the paths as well as what will be created. Next the controller basically sends us to the view as well as to the database through the Model. The Model is basically letting us comunicate to the database using SQL. Once the data is obtained through the Model we are able to place it in a variable e.i @places and call on this variable in the view.

### Database.
I dont really know how to access the database, I assume it is done through ruby terminal. I will have to dove deeper into this in the upcoming week. 

I tried to create a sample app from scratch, and hit a wall on how the naming conventions need to look in order for the MVC to work together. I finally got it through trial and error! Very time consuming.
