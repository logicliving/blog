### Where is the time going?
It has been a lot of copying and following along.

### When will I go solo.
I so want to be able to anticipate what to do next, and be able to build an app from scratch.

I guess it comes with practice. I just want to be able to know the basics, so that I can run solo, and look up issues that arise on the fly. It seems like my hand is still being held. It is very frustrating, because my mentallity does not allow me to just move on. I need to dig in and recreate what we just did, in another format, in order to learn the information. 

I put together this blog using Jekyll. It took me some time to understand the workings of how the pages interact with each other, and then how to deploy to Git hub Pages.
